There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!\r\n\r\n# [Beginning Scientific Programming with MATLAB](#begin)\r\n### Sep. 4, 10–Noon • MEL 1001\r\n\r\nThis workshop targets students with little to no programming experience.  We will conduct a hands-on walkthrough of what MATLAB has to offer as a foundation for later tutorials throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nWe will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n- Variables, functions, sequences, dictionaries\r\n- Libraries and modules\r\n- Loops, logic, and conditionals\r\n- Input/output, files\r\n\r\n(If you don't know what some of these mean, don't worry!  This is a gentle introduction.)\r\n\r\n# [Introduction to MATLAB](#intro)\r\n### Sep. 11, 10–Noon • MEL 1001\r\n### Sep. 25, 10–Noon • MEL 1001\r\n\r\nThis workshop, offered twice, targets students with some prior programming experience in other languages but who are interested in learning MATLAB for research or coursework.  We will conduct a hands-on walkthrough of what MATLAB has to offer as a foundation for later tutorials throughout the semester.  (This workshop will overlap with much of the content in the \"Beginning MATLAB\" course above, so there's no need to attend both.)\r\n\r\nWe will cover the following topics (in more depth than the beginning class above):\r\n\r\n- Libraries and modules\r\n- Loops, logic, and conditionals\r\n- Input/output, files\r\n- Basic numerical examples & matrix solutions\r\n\r\n### Lesson Materials\r\n\r\n![Truss image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/matlab-fa14/gh-pages/lessons/img/truss.png)\r\n\r\n![Truss matrix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/matlab-fa14/gh-pages/lessons/img/truss-matrix.png)\r\n\r\n[Basic Exercises](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/matlab-fa14/blob/gh-pages/lessons/exercises-beginner.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\nSkeleton code for [`computedamrateofflow.m`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/matlab-fa14/gh-pages/lessons/computedamrateofflow.m).\r\n\r\nSpring data:\r\n\r\n    m = [5 10 20 50 100];                 % mass data, g\r\n    d = [15.5 33.07 53.39 140.24 301.03]; % displacement, mm\r\n    g = 9.81;                             % g = 9.81 m/s^2\r\n    F = m/1000 *g;                        % spring force (N)\r\n\r\n# [Numerical Programming with MATLAB](#num-methods)\r\n### Oct. 2, 10–Noon • MEL 1001\r\n### Oct. 9, 10–Noon • MEL 1001\r\n\r\nThis tutorial focuses on the solution of differential equations and similar systems with MATLAB.\r\n\r\n# [Distributed & Parallel MATLAB](#parallel)\r\n### Oct. 16, 10–Noon • MEL 1001\r\n\r\n# [MathWorks site visit:  MATLAB R2014b](#mathworks)\r\n### Oct. 30 • Location TBD\r\n\r\n# [Image Processing in MATLAB](#image)\r\n### Nov. 20, 10–Noon • MEL 1001\r\n\r\n# About These Workshops\r\n### Contributors\r\nNeal Davis, Rishabh Narang, and Erika Fotsch developed these materials.
