{"name":"MATLAB-Fa14","tagline":"","body":"# [Introduction to MATLAB](#intro)\r\n### TBA • MEL 1001\r\n\r\nThis workshop targets students with little programming experience (in general) or with no prior exposure to MATLAB.  We will conduct a hands-on walkthrough of what MATLAB has to offer as a foundation for later tutorials throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nWe will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n- Variables, functions, sequences, dictionaries\r\n- Libraries and modules\r\n- Loops, logic, and conditionals\r\n- Input/output, files\r\n\r\n(If you don't know what any or all of these are, don't worry!  We will explain them.)\r\n\r\nThere is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!  *However, if you are not an engineering student, you will need an EWS login to use the computer lab, so please email Neal Davis (contact information at bottom) at least 24 hours in advance.*\r\n\r\n# [Numerical Programming with MATLAB](#num-methods)\r\n### TBA • MEL 1001\r\n\r\nThis tutorial focuses on the solution of basic differential equations and similar systems with MATLAB.\r\n\r\n# [Distributed & Parallel MATLAB](#parallel)\r\n### TBA • MEL 1001\r\n\r\n# [Image Processing in MATLAB](#image)\r\n### TBA • MEL 1001\r\n\r\n# About These Workshops\r\n### Contributors\r\nNeal Davis, Rishabh Narang, and Erika Fotsch developed these materials.
